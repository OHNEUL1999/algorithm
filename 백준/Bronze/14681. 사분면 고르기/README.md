### 문제 설명

<p>A common problem in mathematics is to determine which quadrant a given point lies in. There are four quadrants, numbered from 1 to 4, as shown in the diagram below:</p>

<p>For example, the point A, which is at coordinates (12, 5) lies in quadrant 1 since both its x and y values are positive, and point B lies in quadrant 2 since its x value is negative and its y value is positive.</p>

<p>Your job is to take a point and determine the quadrant it is in. You can assume that neither of the two coordinates will be 0.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input contains the integer x (−1000 ≤ x ≤ 1000; x ≠ 0). The second line of input contains the integer y (−1000 ≤ y ≤ 1000; y ≠ 0).</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Output the quadrant number (1, 2, 3 or 4) for the point (x, y).</p>
